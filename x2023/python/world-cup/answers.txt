Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
when the simulations are less the prediction also not good as barzil and belgium who have  the highest chance of
winning are not considered the winner only the matches that are held at the start are used for the predictions so
they are not good enough.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
I think after 1000 simulations I believe I can call these predictions good enough.
